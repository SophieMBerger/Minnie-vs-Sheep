# Minnie-vs-Sheep
This is an image classifier which was trained to distinguish between images of my cat "Minnie" and sheep. It makes sense once you see my cat!


To test images:

change directory to Minnie-vs-Sheep
python label_image.py --image= <path> --graph=/Minnie_vs._Sheep/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrained_graph.pb --labels=/Minnie_vs._Sheep/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrained_labels.txt
